            <h4>Micro Radar-based Non-contact Tongue Gesture Recognition</h4>
            <p>The project is targeted to recognize fine-grained movement/gestures wirelessly using micro radar sensors. We built a preliminery system, Tonuge-n-cheek, which can detect subtle facial gestures for people with severe paralysis to control their daily environment. A novel radar signal processing algorithm and a low latency micro-controller implementation is introduced in the system.</p>

            <h4>RF-based Wearable Respiration Monitoring</h4>
            <p>We try to record human's respiration pattern to analyze the relation between asthma and environmental changes. We developed a non-intrusive system that uses a wearable micro radar to monitor human's breathing rate continuously. </p>

            <h4>Vision-based Realtime Accessibility Issues Detection</h4>
            <p> The project aims at using machine vision to detect accessibility issues on sidewalks for helping people with visually-impairment. A prior-based framework is designed to accelerate the computer vision detection process in embedded devices, which uses a cooperation of human and machine. </p>
